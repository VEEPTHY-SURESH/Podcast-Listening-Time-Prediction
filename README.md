# Podcast-Listening-Time-Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict user listening duration based on session and user behavior data. Used feature engineering to extract meaningful patterns and trained models using Linear Regression and Random Forest, achieving strong performance with Random Forest. Focused on reducing error through preprocessing and model tuning.
